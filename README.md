# FlexiWoo (flexi)

FlexiWoo is a headless WooCommerce implementation that provides production-ready frontend templates for WooCommerce using a REST-based architecture.

---

## What FlexiWoo Is

FlexiWoo is **infrastructure**, not a product:

- **Reference Implementation** - A starting point for developers to fork and customize
- **Fork-Friendly** - Opinionated and minimal so you can extend it your way
- **Self-Hosted** - You run your own flexi instance; no SaaS dependency
- **Developer-First** - Designed for developers and agencies, not end-users
- **UI-Only** - Renders HTML pages; does not process payments or manage sessions

For complete positioning, see [docs/POSITIONING.md](docs/POSITIONING.md).

## Features

- **Fast Rendering** - Next.js 16 with React 19 for optimal performance
- **Complete Page Coverage** - Renders ALL WooCommerce pages (products, shop, cart, checkout, thank-you, account, search)
- **WooCommerce Storefront Design** - Familiar UI that matches the popular Storefront theme
- **Secure by Default** - Zod validation, PII sanitization, HTML escaping
- **Graceful Fallback** - Automatically reverts to native WooCommerce if renderer unavailable
- **Production-Ready Logging** - Structured logging with configurable levels and request tracing
- **Easy to Fork** - Clean Tailwind CSS v4 templates that you can customize
- **No Telemetry** - No analytics, tracking, or external service dependencies

---

## Architecture

FlexiWoo consists of two components:

### 1. flexi (This Repository)

**Next.js Rendering Engine**

- **Technology:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Zod
- **Purpose:** Receives page data from WordPress, renders HTML
- **Deployment:** Self-hosted on Vercel, Docker, or any Node.js hosting

### 2. flexi-woo (WordPress Plugin)

**WordPress Bridge** - [See flexi-woo on GitHub](https://github.com/rickey29/flexi-woo)

- **Technology:** PHP 8+, WooCommerce 8+
- **Purpose:** Intercepts WooCommerce pages, sends data to flexi, displays rendered HTML
- **Distribution:** GitHub only (not WordPress.org)

**How it works:**

```
Customer visits WooCommerce page
         ↓
WordPress/flexi-woo intercepts request
         ↓
flexi-woo sends page data to flexi (POST /api/v1/product, /cart, etc.)
         ↓
flexi renders HTML with modern design
         ↓
WordPress displays the rendered page
```
